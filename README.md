### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rui. I took up programming when I was 14, when I started learning Java. In highschool I ventured into competitive programming, solving problems in C++, racking up three final presences in the Portuguese National Olympiad. 

After high school I started studying Software Engineering in University of Minho, having been admited with a perfect score of 20/20, being one of only three students to do so in the entire university. I finished my Bsc in 2023, and am currently working towards getting my Masters degree. 

I am currently the treasurer of [CeSIUM](cesium.di.uminho.pt), where I also help develop and maintain a variety of [repositories](https://github.com/cesium/), spanning from web development using [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) to backend and full stack applications in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) with the [Phoenix Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/).

I am currently a researcher at [HASLab/INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en/centres/haslab).

If you want to contact me, feel free to send me an [e-mail](mailto:rpoliveira02@gmail.com) ! :muscle:
